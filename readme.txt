= How does Mobile Localhost work? =

through various checkpoints and conditions, we defined that running a website is a localhost or internet hosted. if the website is live/ internet hosted our mobile localhost feature not to be allowed because Molo - mobile localhost made only for localhost website and not on the internet hosted website.

When User Turn on Molo, Molo uses IPv4 Address of Laptop/computer where WordPress localhost website install. through the various condition, we turn on Molo, where we change the default website URL and Site address to new IPv4. so website all page and all functions URL redirected to a new IP address. When a user connected with a mobile hotspot or MObile & Laptop with the same wifi. other devices can now access the full features of the website directly through the new IP address based URL on their mobile device browser.

When User Turn OFF Molo we change WordPress Website URL to localhost/your website. and all functions return to a normal website.
